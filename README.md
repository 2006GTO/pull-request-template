# Pull Request Template
A Template for Creating Meaningful Pull Requests

## Pull Requests are an opportunity to teach. 
A PR should not be a barrier between you and shipping code. Instead, approach each PR as a docuement for sharing knowledge. When we teach the assignee/reviewer through a Pull Request, we build confidence that due dilligence and research has been done. The assignee is not a Gatekeeper but a collaborator. Invite them to learn and and be part of the process of shipping code.

## Active Research Document
Like a README, a Pull Request should be updated as research reveals new information. 

### Problem
The `Problem` section should be completed when a Pull Request is first opened. If new problems reveal themselves while writing code, it is an opportunity for a new appropriatly scoped pull request.

## Approach
- [ ] Need To Write the Approach Section

### Learning
The `Learning` section should be an ongoing process. It should contain any libraries, blog-posts, insightful quotes, or programming patterns you used or found inspiration from during the writing of your pull request.
